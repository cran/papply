papply is an apply-like function which uses Rmpi to distribute
the processing evenly across a cluster.  Will use a non-MPI
version if distributed processing is not available.

For something with more extensive capabilities, the 'snow' package
is more thorough.  papply's benefit is mainly that it allows running 
code on non-cluster machines as well - it implicitly executes code
differently depending on whether or not an MPI cluster is available.
(i.e. someone can download and run code without having to set up
an MPI environment - it'll just likely run slower; and you can 
develop your code in a non-MPI environment)

The "default to serial execution" feature, as well as some of the 
debugging additions helps reduce testing and debugging time.
